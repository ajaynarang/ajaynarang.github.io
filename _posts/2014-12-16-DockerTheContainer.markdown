# Docker the "Container" - Build, Ship and Run Any App, Anywhere

Containers *pack and deploy software application*  are getting immense popularity and claims to be next big thing in 2015. Many bigs guns are adoping it over heavy virtual machine.

Today, i came across concise [good article on TechGig](http://www.techgig.com/tech-news/editors-pick/introducing-docker-to-a-java-developer-27740)  on **Docker**.

## What is Docker - A brief introduction 
From [official Docker site](https://www.docker.com/) - *Docker is an open platform for developers and sysadmins to build, ship, and run distributed applications. Consisting of Docker Engine, a portable, lightweight runtime and packaging tool, and Docker Hub, a cloud service for sharing applications and automating workflows, Docker enables apps to be quickly assembled from components and eliminates the friction between development, QA, and production environments. As a result, IT can ship faster and run the same app, unchanged, on laptops, data center VMs, and any cloud.*
